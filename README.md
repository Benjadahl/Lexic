#Lexic
An open source accessibility software for dyslexics.
This is under GNU GPL v3.

Roadmap:
* Make it get text fields from the computer, either with ATK, or some X thing. 
* Use a super-advanced algorithmâ„¢ to predict what the user is going to type, guessing from whatever is getting typed now and the previous word in true Markov Chain style.
* Use text-to-speech
* Make it a pretty GUI program
* Add test cases
